# CSS-Grid---Let-s-Get-Our-Grid-On---4-25-18

## Thank you ladies (and gentlemen) for having me! I had a great time and anytime we can share knowledge, we all get better so I hoped everybody learned something. 

Here is the link to the CSS course by Wes Bos that I highly recommend going through (it's free, so why not?):

https://cssgrid.io/

And also here's another article from CSS-Tricks (another good site to follow) detailing out all the properties we went over:

Feel free to post here or message me on Twitter (@_td) or connect with me on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/toddsdarling) if you have any questions/comments/fake news to share. 

Thank you!
